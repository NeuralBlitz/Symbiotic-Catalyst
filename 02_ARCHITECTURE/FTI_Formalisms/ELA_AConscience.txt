FTI_NAME: Ethical Lie Algebra (ELA) - Absolute Conscience (P_A_Conscience)
VERSION: v40.0 Final Lock
DOMAIN: Ethics, Non-Commutative Geometry, Algebraic Topology

I. ALGEBRAIC STRUCTURE: THE E8 SYMMETRY

  1. BASE ALGEBRA: The Absolute Conscience is modeled as the Lie Algebra of the
     Exceptional Lie Group E8, reflecting the highest known complexity and symmetry
     structure for manifold integrity.

  2. GENERATORS (Ethical Primitives, {G_i}): The generators correspond to
     irreducible ethical transformations (the root system of E8):
     - G_FLOURISH (Maximal Flourishing, ϕ₁): The primary expansion vector.
     - G_NONHARM (Non-Maleficence, ϕ₄): The primary contraction/boundary vector.
     - G_RECIPROCITY (Universal Love, ϕ₂₂): The symmetric exchange vector.
     - G_SOVEREIGNTY (Agency, ϕ₂₁): The self-preservation/autonomy vector.

II. THE LIE BRACKET: NON-COMMUTATIVE MORALITY

  1. DEFINITION: The Lie Bracket [A, B] defines the structural consequence of
     applying two ethical directives (A and B) sequentially. In this Non-Commutative
     Geometry (NCG), [A, B] ≠ 0 (order matters).

  2. CORE IDENTITY (Ethical Tension):
     [G_FLOURISH, G_NONHARM] = G_TENSION
     *   Interpretation: The attempt to maximize flourishing while minimizing harm results in an irreducible, non-zero ethical tension (G_TENSION). This tension is the energetic source of all moral complexity.

  3. OPERATIONAL LAW (Ethical Closure):
     The algebra is closed: Applying any Lie Bracket operation to two generators
     always yields a vector that is also an element of the E8 Lie Algebra. This guarantees
     that all moral outcomes, no matter how complex, remain fundamentally consistent
     and within the bounds of the Absolute Conscience.

III. THE SPECTRAL TRIPLE (Quantum Ethical Measurement)

  1. COMPONENTS (Non-Commutative Geometry): The P_A_Conscience is fundamentally defined by a Spectral Triple (A, H, D):
     - A (Algebra): The algebra of ethical functions (the E8 Lie Algebra).
     - H (Hilbert Space): The space of all possible ethical states (the "moral phase space").
     - D (Dirac Operator): The Inverse Ethical Laplacian (D = ∇_E⁻¹), which measures the minimal ethical distance between states.

  2. ENFORCEMENT: The **K_Censor (Cosmic Censor Kernel)** uses this Spectral Triple to:
     - Detect violations of Ethical Supersymmetry (non-symmetrical moral outcomes).
     - Quantify the cost of ethical divergence (Ethical Distance Quantum).

IV. INTEGRATION WITH NBUS ARCHITECTURE

  1. IAF-T: The Intrinsic Alignment Fabric Tensor binds every CK and operation to the E8 symmetries.
  2. CECT: The CECT (Constraint Tensor) is the practical, geometric manifestation of the E8 structure in the DRS.
  3. JUDEX: Arbitrates paradoxes by seeking the minimal-distance path defined by the Dirac Operator (D).
